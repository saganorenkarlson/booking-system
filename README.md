# booking-system
In this ASP.NET project, a web-based booking system was developed with an MVC architecture and CRUD functionality to manage service bookings. The idea arose from discussions about purchasing a communal car to share. Such a website could thus facilitate by keeping track of when the car is occupied and similar matters. We never bought a car, but with this website, one can create arbitrary services and invite users to share them. The system enables login, registration, and management of user details with security features such as encrypted passwords and session management. The database is created with Azure, and the user interface follows WCAG and WAI guidelines for accessibility. The focus of this project was on the structure and login rather than on the design.
